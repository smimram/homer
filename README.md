Homer - Homotopy and rewriting
==============================
The goal of **Homer** is to provide libraries and tools for higher-dimensional rewriting. Those are mainly written in OCaml.

It currently consists the following parts.


Rewr
----
A tool to manipulate coherent presentations of monoids (various completions procedures, homotopical invariants, etc.).

Bergman 2
---------
A tool to compute Gr√∂bner basis and Anick resolutions for non-commutative algebras.

ocaml-alg
---------
An OCaml library in order to manipulate algebraic structures (groups, modules, algebras, etc.). It is the library which is (or will be) behind the above tools.

Homer - Homotopy and rewriting
==============================
The goal of **Homer** is to provide libraries and tools for higher-dimensional rewriting.

**THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN SUPERSEEDED BY [OCAML-ALG](https://github.com/smimram/ocaml-alg) AND IS NOW ARCHIVED.**

The main programming language is OCaml and most interfaces are done in HTML.

It currently consists the following parts.


[Rewr](https://smimram.github.io/homer/rewr/)
----
A tool to manipulate coherent presentations of monoids (various completions procedures, homotopical invariants, etc.).

[Bergman 2](https://smimram.github.io/homer/bergman/)
---------
A tool to compute Gr√∂bner basis and Anick resolutions for non-commutative algebras.

[ocaml-alg](https://smimram.github.io/homer/ocamldoc/alg/)
---------
An OCaml library in order to manipulate algebraic structures (groups, modules, algebras, etc.). It is the library which is (or will be) behind the above tools.
